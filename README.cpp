# C++ Projects

This repository contains my C++ practice projects and data structures implementations.

## Project: vec Class

**Description:**
- Custom implementation of vector (dynamic array)
- Supports:
  - `push_back` → Add element at end
  - `resize` → Change size of vector
  - `operator[]` → Access elements by index
  - `at()` → Access with exception on out-of-bounds

**Key Concepts Practiced:**
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Dynamic memory management (`new` & `delete`)
- Operator overloading
- Exception handling
- STL-like behavior simulation

**Usage:**
```bash
g++ vec.cpp -o vec
./vec
